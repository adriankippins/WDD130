                Hello everyone, I am from Georgetown Guyana and I'm an Applied Technology Major. I am 100% green as it relates to web development so I’m a bit slow.  
                I believe this class will help as I take advance development courses int the future to complete my degree.
            </p>
            <p>
                I took this class before and had to drop out midway due to personal reasons however I'm ready to move forward this semester. 
                I worked as an IT Infrastructure manager for the past 12 years; I deal primarily with networking however It’s good to learn something new.
            </p>

                Outside of work and study, I am a father of 2 boys and I have been maried for almost 12 years. I am also a powerlifter so I spend a lot of time in the gym lifting extremely heavy weights.
                Wishing everyone the best in this course.
